# Movie browser example

A movie browser to:

- View now playing movies
- Search for a movie in the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Get more info like video trailers, similar movies and user reviews.

 Built with [Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and Typescript only! No JS or CSS frameworks like Angular, React, Tailwind... Just pure JS and Web standards!
